# Deployment Issue - Large Image File

## Problem
The GitHub Pages deployment is failing due to the large profile picture file size:
- **Current Size**: 2.7MB - 3.1MB
- **GitHub Limit**: GitHub has file size limits and the deployment is failing with HTTP 400 error

## Solution Required

### Option 1: Optimize the Existing Image (RECOMMENDED)
You need to optimize `ProfilePic.jpg` before deployment:

#### Using Online Tools:
1. Go to [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
2. Upload `/public/images/profile/ProfilePic.jpg`
3. Resize to **400×400 pixels** (more than enough for the header)
4. Set quality to **80-85%**
5. Download and replace the original file

**Expected Result**: File size should be ~30-100KB (acceptable for GitHub)

#### Using Command Line (if you have ImageMagick):
```bash
cd public/images/profile
convert ProfilePic.jpg -resize 400x400^ -gravity center -extent 400x400 -quality 85 ProfilePic-optimized.jpg
mv ProfilePic-optimized.jpg ProfilePic.jpg
```

### Option 2: Use a Temporary Smaller Image
Create a smaller version for now:
1. Open the image in any photo editor
2. Resize to 400×400px
3. Export as JPG with 80% quality
4. Replace the current file

### Option 3: Host Images Externally
If you need to keep high-resolution images:
- Upload to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) (free tier)
- Upload to [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/)
- Upload to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- Then reference the external URL in your code

## After Optimization

Once you've optimized the image:

1. **Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Check the size**:
   ```bash
   ls -lh dist/images/profile/ProfilePic.jpg
   ```
   Should show < 200KB

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Current Status
- ✅ Header code updated to use ProfilePic.jpg
- ✅ Image displays correctly in local development
- ❌ Deployment failing due to file size
- 🔄 Waiting for image optimization

---

**Next Step**: Optimize the profile picture and redeploy.
